Array                           Collection
-----                           ----------
* Fixed in size                 * Collections are grow-able in Nature
* Can hold only homogenous      * Can hold homogenous or heterogeneous
  type                          * Recommended to use to Stop memory wastage as
* Memory point of view,           it grows on demand
